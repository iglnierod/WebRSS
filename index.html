                    <p><br /><br /><br />The arrival of a DANA over the weekend brought heavy rain and violent storms
                        to much of Spain, particularly in the Valencian Community, Catalonia and Aragón,
                        where a 17-year-old boy Iost his life when a tree fell on top of him as he was
                        sheltering from the weather.<br /></p>
                    <p>
                        These areas Will have a bit of a break this week, according to the State
                        Meteorological Agency (Aemet), but other areas of the country Will bear the brunt
                        of several incoming Atlantic fronts.
                        The first of these storms Will arrive on Sunday November 13 and run well into
                        Monday, putting Galicia on yellow level alert for strong winds and bringing
                        abundant rainfall to parts of Asturias and León. Showers are likely to extend to the
                        northeast of Catalonia and the Balearic Islands on Monday afternoon, November
                        14.

                    </figure>
                    <p>A second, more active front Will sweep in during the early hours of Tuesday
                        November 15. An Aemet spokesperson predicts that the storm "Will cross the
                        Peninsula from northwest to southeast", leaving l'cloudy or overcast skies and
                        precipitation" in its wake, which should weaken as the day goes on.<br /><br />
                        No rain is forecast in the Mediterranean area or in the southeast of Spain on
                        Tuesday.
                        However, this front Will continue its advance across the country on Wednesday
                        November 16, bringing overcast skies and weak rain to the southeast early in the
                        day as a third Atlantic front enters from the northwest. While this Will be relatively
                        weak, it Will nevertheless result in persistent rainfall in Galicia and frequent
                        showers in the south.
                    </p>
                    <p>Looking ahead to Thursday November 17 and the Mediterranean coast should
                        remain dry although a cloudy and rather humid day is expected overall. It Will be
                        mostly overcast, with frequent showers and some heavy rain forecast in the
                        northwest.
                    </p>
                    <p>The arrival of the DANA resulted in a dramatic drop in temperature all across
                        Spain and this downward trend Will continue into the middle of the week. The
                        most notable change has been felt in the minimum temperatures after weeks of
                        tropical nights, while areas like Alicante and Murcia are Still experiencing balmy,
                        spri ng-like days with the thermometers hovering at around 260C.

                <p> Former President Donald Trump, aiming to become only the second commander-in-chief ever elected to
                    two nonconsecutive terms, announced Tuesday night that he Will seek the Republican presidential nomination in
                    2024.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "In order to make America great and glorious again, I am tonight announcing my candidacy for president of the
                    United States," Trump told a crowd gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his waterfront estate in Florida, where his campaign
                    Will be headquartered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Surrounded by allies, advisers, and conservative influencers, Trump delivered a
                    relatively subdued speech, rife with spurious and exaggerated claims about his four
                    years in office. Despite a historically divisive presidency and his own role in inciting an
                    attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Trump aimed to evoke nostalgia for his
                    time in office, frequently contrasting his first-term accomplishments with the Biden
                    administration's policies and the current economic climate. Many of those perceived
                    accomplishments - from strict immigration actions to corporate tax cuts and religious
                    freedom initiatives - remain deeply polarizing to this day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Trump to a roomful of Republicans who expect him to face primary
                    challengers in the coming months, he also claimed the party cannot afford to nominate
                    "a politician or conventional candidate" if it wants to win back the White House.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "This Will not be my campaign, this Will be our campaign all together," Trump said.<br /><br />
                    Trump's long-awaited campaign comes as he tries to reclaim the spotlight following the GOP's underwhelming
                    midterm elections performance — including the losses of several Trump-endorsed election deniers - and the
                    subsequent blame game that has unfolded since Election Day. Republicans failed to gain a Senate majority, came
                    up short in their efforts to fill several statewide seats, and have yet to secure a House majority, with only 215 races
                    called in their favor so far out of the 218 needed, developments that have forced Trump and other party leaders into
                    a defensive posture as they face reproval from within their ranks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "l have no doubt that by 2024, it Will sadly be much worse and they Will see clearly what has happened and is
                    happening to our country - and the voting Will be much different," he claimed.

                    This Hawaiian Cat Loves SurfingWith His Human Parents. Hokule'a is a
                    kitty who loves the rain, ocean, pool, and catching waves. His parents first
                    realized he liked the water when he would choose to stay outdoors on a
                    rainy day. Soon after that, he proved to be a fantastic swimmer who also
                    enjoys riding on the front of a surfboard in gentle waters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His human dad built him a little nest to sit in on the surfboard, so he can be
                    secure while riding the waves. His parents say he enjoys being in the water
                    for about an hour at a time. After spending some quality time at the beach,
                    Hokule'a goes home to take a bath and rest. This cat is a better swimmer
                    than I am!
